# Action Key Piano
A Trackmania 2020 plugin that plays a music note when you press an action key! Live out your dream of being a true action key pianist! Configure which instrument is played and which note gets played for each action key.

Besides the obvious message about AKs and the new cars, this plugin has real value for people that want auditory cues when they enable/disable action keys.

Available music notes: ![Screenshot of all music notes that are provided for each instrument.](/assets/Images/Music%20notes.png)
